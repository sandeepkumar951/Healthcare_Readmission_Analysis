# 🔍 Key Findings — Healthcare Readmission Analysis

## 1. Readmission Risk Increases with Age
Older patients, particularly those aged 60+, show significantly higher 30-day readmission rates. Age is a strong but not standalone risk factor.

## 2. Length of Stay Is a Strong Indicator
Patients with hospital stays longer than 7 days are far more likely to be readmitted, indicating higher clinical complexity.

## 3. Prior Utilization Strongly Predicts Readmission
Patients with previous inpatient or emergency visits have consistently higher readmission rates, highlighting recurring care needs.

## 4. Medication Burden Correlates with Risk
Patients prescribed a high number of medications exhibit elevated readmission rates, reflecting chronic and complex conditions.

## 5. Risk Stratification Is Effective
Advanced SQL-based risk scoring successfully segments patients into quartiles, with the highest-risk quartile accounting for a disproportionate share of readmissions.

## 6. Readmissions Are Concentrated
A small subset of high-risk patients contributes to a large percentage of early readmissions, presenting a clear intervention opportunity.
